# ðŸ§ª Testing Guide - Cart & Payment Flow

## âœ… FIXED - Cart Page Issues

### What Was Wrong:
- Cart page was redirecting to home on refresh
- Orders page was redirecting to home on refresh
- This was breaking the normal user flow

### What I Fixed:
1. **Removed Refresh Redirects**: Cart and Orders pages no longer redirect on refresh
2. **Normal Navigation**: Users can now refresh cart/orders pages normally
3. **Proper Flow**: Cart â†’ PlaceOrder â†’ Payment â†’ Orders
